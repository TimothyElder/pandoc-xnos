Developer Notes
===============

Contributions to this project are welcome.  In particular, full docx support
is awaiting input from a knowledgeable expert on how to structure the OOXML.

    
Branches
--------

The next release is developed in the `nextrelease` branch.  When ready, the
changes are merged into the `master` branch.

Version 2.0 is being temporarily developed in a separate `2.0` branch.  When
ready, it will be merged into the `nextrelease` branch.


Install Alternatives
--------------------

1) To install a pre-release version of pandoc-xnos from pypi, the --pre flag
   should be used with pip.

2) To install directly from the github repository use:

       $ pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos.git --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

3) To install from the `nextrelease` branch on github, use

       $ pip install \
         git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos.git@nextrelease --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

4) To install from source, `cd` into the source directory and use

       pip install -e . --user

   Note that any changes made to the source will be automatically reflected
   when the filter is run (which is useful for development).


Testing
-------

Unit tests for pandoc-xnos are provided in test/.
